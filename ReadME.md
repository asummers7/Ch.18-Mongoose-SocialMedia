# Ch.18-Mongoose-SocialMedia


## Description
This was a project to introduce the student to the use of Mongoose. We were to use the mongoose language to interact with a mysql database. The goal of this was to create a server this took in a user with additional functionality like the ability to add a friend, thoughts, and reactions. The server was then to be ran on insomnia to see if the connections were properly made.
